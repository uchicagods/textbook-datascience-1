Programming in Python
====================

Computer programming can dramatically improve our ability to collect and analyze information
about the world, which in turn can lead to discoveries through the kind of careful
reasoning demonstrated in the previous section.

In Data Science, the purpose of writing a program is to instruct a computer to carry
out the steps of an analysis.

Computers cannot study the world on their own. People must describe precisely what
steps the computer should take in order to collect and analyze data, and those steps
are expressed through programs.

Programming languages, such as <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a>,
provide the computer programmer linguistic tools through which to compose programs.
We'll begin with the *expression*.
