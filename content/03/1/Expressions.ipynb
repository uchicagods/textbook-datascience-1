    "Programming languages are simpler than human languages. Nonetheless, there are rules of grammar to learn in any language. In this text, we will use the <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Python</a> programming language. It's essential to learn its grammatical rules &ndash; the same rules governing the most basic programs are also central to the most sophisticated.\n",

    "Computer programs are fundamentally constituted by *expressions*, which instruct the computer how to manipulate pieces of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a multiplication expression consists of a `*` symbol written between two numerical expressions. The expression `3 * 4` may be *evaluated* by the computer, via Python. The value of the expression &ndash; the result of its evaluation &ndash; is `12`.\n",
