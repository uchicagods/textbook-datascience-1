    "Much of the world's data is text. In many programming languages, text is referred to as a *string*, as in \"a string of characters.\" A string can represent a single character, a word, a sentence, or even the contents of every book in a library. Since text can include characters representing numbers (such as `\"5\"`), a string can be used to describe that as well.\n",

In Python, this is still an *addition expression*; but, it is combining a different type of value – strings rather than numbers."
